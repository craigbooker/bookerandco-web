I thought it would be interesting to find some way of sharing what it is I am learning each week. I am not sure this will be all that valuable to readers, but I hope to find a way to make it useful. One of my goals with this series is to catalogue what courses I am going through and the concepts or topics I am learning.

This week I am going through a tutorial on Udemy called

[iOS 12 and Swift 4.2 for Beginners: 200+ Hands-On Tutorials](https://www.udemy.com/share/100F3uAkUfeV1VQw==/?xref=E0AddVZRQnoLPUQvCz0GJFABTmM=)
