As I have started exploring more about what it means to surrender, I have discovered that surrendering to God has many layers. As every believer grows closer to God, they will soon discover there are other layers of surrender. As a believer navigates along this path of surrender, God will inevitably call you to believe in His Plan, belief in His goodness, and yield all control to Him and Him alone.
