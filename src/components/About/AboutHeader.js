            I'm a Writer and Software Developer from Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. My
            love for electronics started while tinkering with electronics when I
            was young. This love for electronic turned into a love for computers
            which in turn lead me to software. My earliest memeories of writing
            was between 2000 and 2001. I wrote off and on for fifteen years
            before I would discover it was a gift. It was always just something
            I did in my spare time to express myself. I never considered it as
            my passion or as a potential career.

            It was while working at Apple where I would learn about Appleâ€™s
            methods in training individuals to get the most out of their
            technology. I also learned about their people-first culture and a
            true appreciation of people of all types. It was while working at
            Apple that I affirmed some of my ideas on customer service. I aim to
            take what I learned at Apple, combining the best customer service, a
            love for great apps and dedication to customers to provide the best
            products and services.
